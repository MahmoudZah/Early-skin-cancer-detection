# Mobile App Assets

Create these placeholder images:

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024) - App icon with microscope or medical symbol
2. **splash.png** (1242x2436) - Splash screen with app branding
3. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024) - Android adaptive icon
4. **favicon.png** (48x48) - Web favicon

You can create these using any image editor or design tool. For now, the app will work without them but may show warnings.

For a quick start, you can use placeholder images from https://placeholder.com/ or create simple colored squares with the app name.
